            Team India‚Äôs ace spinner <b>Ravichandran Ashwin </b> will be playing
            his <b>100th Test match</b> next week. <br />The bowling

            him cross the milestone, but his family members are not yet sure
            whether they will be able to watch him perform live. <br />Ashwin‚Äôs
            mother, who was hospitalised, is now recovering, and the family may

            four-wicket figures in an innings, 10-wicket hauls in a match eight
            times and over 3300 runs and five centuries to his credit, Ashwin‚Äôs
            Test career has been nothing less than iconic.

            TPCC president and Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy will launch the
            Congress campaign for the Lok Sabha polls on February 2 at
            Indravelli in Adilabad district, site of the massacre of Gond
            tribals in 1981 and the place where the Goddess Nagoba temple is
            located. Indravelli also holds sentimental value for Revanth Reddy.
            He addressed his first public meeting as TPCC president in August
            2021 in Indravelli, titled Dalitha Girijana Dandora.The Indravelli
            event will be Revanth Reddy's first public meeting after he assumed
            charge as Chief Minister of Telangana on December 7 last. His
            campaign launch previously scheduled for January 26 was postponed
            due to his prior engagements. The TPCC political affairs committee
            (PAC) is expected to meet on January 30 at Gandhi Bhavan to initiate
            the process of identifying candidates for Lok Sabha polls.

          <h3>IT-Hyderabad Start-up WiSig Partners with Intel for 5G ORAN</h3>
          <p>
            WiSig Networks, a start-up born out of IIT-Hyderabad, has teamed up
            with Intel Corporation to unveil the ORAN Massive MIMO ULPI Radio
            Solution in the 5G space, to revolutionise how we experience mobile
            connectivity. Simply put, WiSig's innovation strengthens the phone's
            signal, especially in places where it‚Äôs weak. The technology is open
            and adaptable, meaning it can work with different devices, from
            phones to smart gadgets. IIT-H‚Äôs Prof. Kiran Kuchi, mastermind
            behind WiSig Networks, said the technology promised 10x improvement
            in uplink cell edge coverage. Mike Fitton, vice-president of the
            Networking Business Unit in Intel‚Äôs Programmable Solutions Group,
            commended WiSig's efforts, and expressed excitement about the
            potential of the technology to redefine the status quo in AN
            protocol implementations.
